# a1 - Just Breathe

## Description

Spending a minute or two focussing on your breathing can be really beneficial.

One easy way to do this is to breathe along with an animated graphic:

*There are thousands of these on Google if you're looking for inspiration*

In this challenge, build an animated graphic as a breathing guide using standard web technologies.

- Use any frontend technology you want.
- The graphic must be rendered on **http://localhost:4200** by running **yarn run**.
- Feel free to display it in any way you want - it doesn't have to be a fancy animation, it could be a countdown or some basic text. It could be very abstract, it's up to you. 
- When you're done, please record it as a **gif** (check Peek if you need a tool) and **include it in your pull request**. *Hoping whoever gets to review your PR has the most relaxing time ever*.
- Avoid using an external tool to generate the entire graphic and animation. I think there are edge cases to this, so if you're unsure just ask.
- There are many different structures for these breathing exercises. 4 in, 4 out. 6 in, 2 hold, 4 out, 2 hold. Use any.

### Things to focus on for a good solution

- Configurable: could you change the parameters of the breathing exercise at runtime? If so, it's configurable.
- Juicy: juice is subjective, but it's when it feels amazing to look at.
- Readable: this could be a surprisingly complex challenge, emphasise building readable code over minimal code. 

### Things you could learn from this

- How to breathe
- How to work with time; timers, schedules and animations
- (Optional) How to use a drawing framework to create graphical elements

## Getting started

- Choose and Initialise your frontend tooling in the repo.
- Make sure appropriate gitignore is setup and that yarn run serves your site on localhost:4200.
- Maybe breath a bit to relax?
- Do the thing.
